# Project-A-01-Server
My basic first project, as of right now it will probably have something to do wtih servers or how to set up your dedicated servers for any game.
First time trying GitHub though, so stay with me here, i´ll try my best.
I´m an innovative hobbyst from Spain, Valladolid, wishing to start creating a name for myself via my projeccts, my main goal is to aid fellow developers, gamers...etc. And make new friends and things for the community.
